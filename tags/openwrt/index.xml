The reason was, I wanted to have a control of a network stack, and possibly - to install
OpenWRT on my own router.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This happened to be possible (thanks Netia!), and besides that, they provide public ipv4 as well
(dynamic, but stays persistent many days if connected).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next steps were to experiment - test IPv6 network and possibilities.
Installation of a tunnel was half-straightforward - hurricane electric tunnel is/was not used
(they not allow registering account @protonmail address). In the end, I have to reconsider HE tunnel.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
