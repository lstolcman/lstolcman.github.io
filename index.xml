Lets do a quick check:

The case is as following - I wanted to use pre-commit and one of its features is excluding certain files or folders from linting. I would like to make use of it - specify a list of folders to exclude in nice, multi-line human-readable format.</description></item><item><title>Adding/editing text to PDF files</title><link>https://lstolcman.github.io/post/add-text-to-pdf/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jan 2022 18:43:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://lstolcman.github.io/post/add-text-to-pdf/</guid><description>I needed to add text to some pdf documents and later sign it with qualified electronic signature.
Freeware Foxit PDF Reader can be used to add/edit a text in pdf. I used version 11.1 from portableapps.
To add text, search for option &amp;ldquo;Add Text&amp;rdquo;. Do not use &amp;ldquo;Typewriter&amp;rdquo; option, as it adds text as a &amp;ldquo;comment&amp;rdquo;, which can be edited afterwards (even if signed by certificate).</description></item><item><title>Initial dev config of cmder and git</title><link>https://lstolcman.github.io/post/initial-dev-config/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 21:39:59 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://lstolcman.github.io/post/initial-dev-config/</guid><description>Git A version control, which anybody should be familiar with (at least when one is a developer ðŸ˜€).
The configuration is simple two steps - ssh keys generation, and .gitconfig

Of course, it turned out to be impossible the easy way due to CGNATs everywhere (actually both networks were CGNATed).
The solution is VPN. After checking the available options, I decided to set up my own. My thought was - why pay 5 EUR for something, when I can have a VPS for less, and use it also for other purposes, not only VPN (think e.</description></item></channel></rss>
