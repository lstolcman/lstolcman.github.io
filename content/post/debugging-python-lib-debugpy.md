Sometimes we would like to know how an external library works, or the documentation is not sufficient to understand its
behavior. "The code should be self-explanatory" - let's take advantage of it.

The case is as following - I wanted to use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) and one of its features is excluding
certain files or folders from linting. I would like to make use of it - specify a list of folders to exclude in nice,
multi-line human-readable format. Unfortunately, the documentation was vague about how it should be formatted exactly.
At this point, my experiments failed. How could I know the proper format?

Debugging and actual code to the rescue :rocket:

Fortunately, I found that under the hood, the value of `exclude:` is treated as string and feed into `re.compile` and
`re.search` python function. Debugging its internals helped me to understand how it works, and made it work.

## Debugging external library

### Prerequisities

First of all, I use `venv` (`python -m venv venv`), so the system is not bloated. After setting the environment, the
packages are installed as usual, using `pip`.

The setup consists of:

- the editor - VS Code
- debug link - [debugpy](https://github.com/microsoft/debugpy)
- the package itself - in my example it is `pre-commit`

### Setting up

Two stage setup:

1. VS Code configuration for debugging

    ![Select python](/images/create-debug-config-python.png)
    ![Select Remote attach](/images/create-debug-config-remote-attach.png)

    The most important step afterwards - set `justMyCode` to `false`:

2. Running the subject with debugger attached

    Open console, use your venv, and run the code:

    ```sh
    (venv) Î» python -m debugpy --listen 0.0.0.0:5678 --wait-for-client  -m pre_commit run --all-files
    ```

    The debugger is waiting for attach. What's left is finding your library entrypoint,
    setting a breakpoint, and starting debugging.
