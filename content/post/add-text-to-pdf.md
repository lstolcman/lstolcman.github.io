I needed to add text to some pdf documents and later sign it with [qualified electronic signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualified_electronic_signature).

Freeware Foxit PDF Reader can be used to add/edit a text in pdf. I used version 11.1 from portableapps.

To add text, search for option "Add Text". *Do not* use "Typewriter" option, as it adds text as a "comment", which can be edited afterwards (even if signed by certificate).
